## 🧠 Business Insights Discovered

📌 **Key takeaways derived from SQL and Power BI:**

* ✈️ **IndiGo leads in volume**, but **Air India** drives higher ticket pricing — strategy should differ per brand.
* 💸 **Non-stop flights cost ₹1000+ more** on average — ideal for premium positioning.
* 🕕 Morning flights (6–9 AM) have **higher average prices**, reflecting business traveler behavior.
* 📍 Routes like **Delhi–Mumbai** and **Hyderabad–Bangalore** are **top revenue zones**.
* 📊 Multiple Carriers category shows high price deviation — potential inconsistency or service gaps.

## 🐍 Python Work Highlights

Notebook: `2.0-EDA+And+FE+Flight+Price.ipynb`

* Cleaned missing/ambiguous data (`Duration`, `Total_Stops`)
* Feature Engineered:

  * `Duration in minutes`
  * `Route` column
  * `Departure and Arrival Periods`
  * `Price Range` buckets
* Solved business-focused EDA questions with visualizations

---

## 🧾 Advanced SQL Query Highlights

Script: `SQLQuery Flight Price.sql`

* **CTEs**: Used to identify top 3 routes by revenue
* **Window Functions**: Ranking airlines by average price
* **Nested Subqueries**: To detect below-median priced flights
* **Joins**: For route-level comparisons and summaries

> The queries are designed to simulate **real-time dashboards or reports** that would be used in actual airline BI systems.
